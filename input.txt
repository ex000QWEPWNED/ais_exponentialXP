Once upon a time, there was a big, round tree. This tree was the largest in a big park full of green grass and bright flowers. Every day, kids would come to play under the tree. Its leaves were bright and its branches were wide.

One sunny day, a small bird named Bobo flew to the park. Bobo had seen the round tree from high in the sky. He liked the big tree and thought, "I want to sit in this round tree. It seems like a good place to rest."

Bobo flew down and said to the tree, "Hello, big, round tree. Can I sit on your branch?" The tree was very nice and said, "Yes, Bobo, you can sit on my branch." So, Bobo sat on the branch and it was nice and cool under the tree.

Bobo loved the tree. He liked to sit on the round tree all day, watching the kids play. But one day, a big wind came. It was so strong, it blew Bobo right off the branch.

"Help!" Bobo cried as he flew away. He wanted to stay on the round tree, but the wind was too strong. Bobo tried to fly back but could not. And just like that, Bobo was gone, taken away by the wind.

And that was the sad end. Bobo was gone and the round tree was alone again. The tree missed Bobo very much, and the park was not as happy without the small bird who used to sit on the big, round tree.

Once upon a time, there was a little green butterfly named Lily. Lily was the only green butterfly in her group. All her friends were red, blue, and yellow. They would fly and play all day in the big, sunny meadow.

One day, while playing, Lily saw a big dog. The dog was big and fluffy, and his fur was as white as snow. She flew down to say hi to the dog. "Hi dog, I am Lily. What is your name?" Lily asked.

The dog looked at Lily and said, "I am Max. Nice to meet you, Lily." Max liked Lily. He liked her green wings. They talked and played for a while, and they became good friends.

One day, Lily flew down to play with Max. She saw him sitting under a big tree. But when Max saw Lily, he did something different. He began to bark. "Woof, woof!" Max barked. He barked and barked.

Lily was very scared. She flew up into the air to get away from the loud noise. But as she flew up, a big bird saw her. The bird came down fast and caught Lily. Max stopped barking and watched as Lily was carried away by the bird. After that day, Lily was never seen again. Max felt bad. He missed his green butterfly friend.

Once upon a time, there was a very sleepy dog named Ben. Ben was so sleepy that he would doze off while he walked, or even while he ate. He was always, always tired.

One day, Ben saw a big sandwich on the table. "Yum," thought Ben, "I want that sandwich." But the sandwich was high up on the table. Ben would have to jump to get it.

"Jump, Ben, Jump!" said Ben to himself. He tried to jump, but he was too sleepy. He fell down and went back to sleep. After a while, he woke up and tried again. He jumped and jumped, but the sandwich was still too high for him.

After a long day of trying, Ben was very tired. He said, "I am too sleepy. I will try tomorrow." But when he woke up the next day, the sandwich was gone. A bird had seen it through the window and taken it away. Ben was sad. He was so sleepy and now, he had no sandwich.

Once upon a time, there was a big red balloon. It was not just a balloon; it was a very fast balloon. This balloon could fly all over the sky in no time. It could touch the tall trees and then zip up to the white clouds.

One sunny day, the balloon met a thirsty bird. The bird said, "Balloon, can you help me? I need to drink water, but the pond is so far." The balloon, being fast, said, "Hop on, little bird. I can take you there."

So, the bird sat on the balloon, and they flew fast to the pond. The bird drank all the water it needed. It was so happy. But the balloon was near a sharp stick.

Suddenly, pop! The balloon hit the stick. It was not fast anymore. It could not fly. The bird was sad. His fast friend, the balloon, was gone. Now, he had to fly back on his own. It was a bad day for the bird and the balloon. The end.

Once upon a time, there was a teddy bear named Teddy. Teddy had a sharp nose, not like most teddy bears. His nose was so sharp, it looked like a small, shiny cone. Teddy lived in a small, warm room full of toys, but he felt alone because his nose was not like the others.

One day, Teddy met a bunny toy named Fluffy. Fluffy had soft, big ears and a cute little tail. Teddy liked Fluffy very much. He said, "Hi, Fluffy! Will you be my friend?" Fluffy looked at Teddy's sharp nose and said, "Yes, Teddy! We can be friends."

Teddy and Fluffy played together all day. They would talk, laugh, and have fun. But when it was time to sleep, Teddy would poke Fluffy with his sharp nose. "Ouch! Teddy, your nose is too sharp," Fluffy would say. Teddy would feel sad, but he would say sorry and try to keep his sharp nose away.

This happened every night. Teddy tried his best, but his sharp nose always hurt Fluffy. Fluffy started to cry and didn't want to sleep next to Teddy anymore. Teddy felt very sad, he didn't want to be alone again.

One night, Teddy poked Fluffy too hard. "Ouch! Teddy, no more!" Fluffy cried and hopped away to sleep with the other toys. Teddy was left alone in the dark, feeling sad.

One day, a small car named Speedy came along. Speedy could go very fast. Speedy saw Big Red and said, "Why are you so sad, Big Red?" Big Red said, "I am so heavy. I can not go fast like you, Speedy." Speedy did not know what to say, so he just laughed.

This made Big Red even more sad. "I do not like that you laugh at me, Speedy. It is not nice," said Big Red. But Speedy just laughed more. Big Red felt very bad.

Then, one day, Big Red saw a big hill. Big Red had a bad idea. "If I go down this big hill, I can go fast," he thought. So, Big Red went down the big hill.

But Big Red was too heavy. He went too fast. At the bottom of the hill, Big Red could not stop. He hit a tree. Big Red was hurt. He could not move anymore. Speedy came and saw Big Red. He did not laugh this time. He was sad, too. But it was too late. Big Red was broken. And this was the end of Big Red.

Once upon a time, there was a bunny named Ben. Ben was a very loud bunny. He liked to hop and thump his big feet all day and night. All the other animals in the woods were not happy because they could not sleep.

One day, Bird said to Ben, "Ben, you are too loud. We cannot sleep. Can you please be quiet?" Ben just laughed and hopped away. He did not care that he was loud. He just wanted to hop and thump his feet.

In the day, when Ben was not hopping, he liked to draw. He would pick up a stick with his small paws and draw in the dirt. He drew big pictures of carrots and small pictures of his bunny friends. But he was still loud. He would laugh and shout as he drew.

So, the animals had a big meeting. They decided to ask Owl to talk to Ben. Owl was very wise and they hoped he could make Ben understand. Owl went to Ben and said, "Ben, you must stop being so loud. If you don't, we will have to send you away."

But Ben did not listen to Owl. He kept hopping and being loud. The animals were sad but they had to keep their word. They told Ben he could not stay in the woods anymore.

And so, Ben, the loud bunny who liked to draw, had to leave his home. It was a very bad day for Ben, but he had not listened when his friends had asked him to be quiet.

Once upon a time, there was a robot. The robot was very smooth. It was shiny like a big spoon. It had lights for eyes and big, round wheels to move.

One day, the robot saw a cat. The cat was up in a tree. "Come down, cat," said the robot. But the cat was too scared to move.

So, the robot had an idea. It started to dance. It twirled around and around. It moved its big, round wheels fast and slow. The cat watched the robot. The robot hoped the dance would make the cat laugh and forget being scared.

And it worked! The cat laughed at the robot's dance. It was a funny sight to see. The cat forgot it was scared. It climbed down from the tree. It landed on the smooth, shiny robot.

But then, a sad thing happened. The cat's claws scratched the robot. The robot wasn't smooth and shiny anymore. The robot was hurt and the cat ran away. The robot couldn't dance anymore. It was a bad day for the robot. It learned that not all plans work out how you want.

One day, the big cat saw a little bird. The bird was up in a tree. "Hello, bird!" said the cat. "Can you fly?" The bird said, "Yes, I can fly. Can you jump high like me?" The big cat was happy. He wanted to show the bird that he could jump very high too.

"Watch me!" said the big cat. He jumped. He jumped so high that he touched the sky. The bird was very surprised. The cat was happy because he jumped so high.

But then, something bad happened. The cat was so big, and he jumped so high, that when he came down, he fell into a hole. The hole was deep, and the cat was stuck. He could not jump out of the hole because it was too deep. The bird tried to help, but the bird was too small.

The big cat was sad. He missed jumping up and down. He missed the sun and the trees. He missed his friends. But the hole was too deep. The big cat could not jump out. The end was bad. The big cat was stuck in the hole forever.

Once upon a time, there was a big red ball. The ball loved to roll and play in the bright sun. It would roll down hills, through the grass, and even in the mud!

The red ball went to the top of the big hill. The top of the hill was so high. The ball could see all the way to the blue sky. The ball was very happy and said, "This will be the best roll ever!" With that, the ball began to roll down the hill.

The red ball rolled fast down the hill. It was so much fun! The ball went faster and faster, laughing all the way. But, as the ball was having fun, it did not see a big hole in the ground. The ball rolled right into the hole. "Oh no!" cried the ball as it fell into the hole.

Inside the hole, it was dark and cold. The ball was scared. "Help! I am stuck!" cried the ball, but no one could hear. The red ball was stuck in the hole. It could not roll or play anymore. The ball was very sad and missed the bright sun.

The next day, some kids came to play on the hill. They saw the hole and the red ball inside. "Look, a ball is stuck in the hole!" said one kid. But the hole was too deep and the kids could not reach the ball. They tried to help, but in the end, they had to leave the ball behind.

One day, a little bird came to the tall tree. The little bird said, "Tree, you are so big. Can you dance?" The tree was silent. It could not talk. But it wanted to try. It wanted to dance for the little bird.

The next day, the sun came up. The tree tried to dance. It moved its big branches. It shook its green leaves. It swayed back and forth. Back and forth. The little bird laughed and said, "Tree, you are good at dancing!"

All the kids saw the tall tree dance. They clapped. They laughed. They thought it was fun. But then, the tree danced too hard. It shook and shook. And then, it fell down. Crash!

The kids were sad. The little bird was sad. The tall tree was no more. It was just a big log now. The little bird said, "I am sorry, tree. I did not want you to fall." But it was too late. The tall tree could not dance anymore. And that was the end of the big, tall tree.

Spot and the cat began to play. They ran around and around. They played with the red ball. They had a lot of fun. Spot was so happy, he forgot about his promise to the cat. Spot let out a big, happy bark. The cat got scared and ran away.

Spot looked around. The cat was gone. He was alone with his red ball. He felt sad. He missed his new friend. Spot learned that day that his big, loud bark could scare away his friends. From that day, Spot was not as happy as before. He still played with his red ball, but he missed playing with the cat.

Tim was sad. He wanted to play, but the big red ball would not move. So, he went to the sun and asked, "Sun, can you help me move the big red ball?" The sun just smiled and said, "I am too far to help you, Tim. But I can give you light and warmth."

So, Tim tried to push the ball again, using all his might. But the ball still did not move. Tim was very tired, so he decided to sleep. He hoped that when he woke up, the ball would have moved.

The cloud was sad. It wanted to see the houses, trees, and the big blue sea. So, the kite had an idea. "I will draw for you," said the kite. "I will draw the things I see down below. I will write with my long tail in the sky."

The next day, Tim came back. He wore his big, hard shoe. He took a step back and then he ran up to the tree. With a loud "Thud!", Tim kicked the tree as hard as he could. All the bright red apples fell down, even the one Tim had talked to. They fell on the hard ground.

Days passed, and Lily and the flower became good friends. They would talk and Lily would draw all day. But one day, Lily's mom saw the flower. She thought it was dead. Without knowing it was Lily's friend, she threw it away.
